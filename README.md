👋 Hi, I’m @renilrajan
I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer & AI Developer based in Kerala, India. I specialize in designing scalable distributed systems, building intuitive user interfaces, and integrating machine learning models into production-ready applications. With a strong foundation in Java, TypeScript, and Python, I thrive on bridging the gap between robust backend architectures and intelligent, data-driven solutions.

Whether it's training anomaly detection models, architecting event-driven microservices, or crafting responsive enterprise UIs, I enjoy tackling complex engineering challenges from end to end.

🚀 Complex Systems & AI/ML Projects
AI-Driven PII Compliance Guardrail: Developing an advanced Google Workspace Add-on that goes beyond basic pattern matching. Utilizing custom-trained NLP models (Named Entity Recognition) in Python to automatically scan, classify, and mask sensitive PII in real-time document workflows.

Predictive IoT Water Monitoring Platform: Architecting a high-throughput backend system (Java/Spring Boot) to ingest sensor data from dispersed water-monitoring nodes. The system integrates a time-series machine learning pipeline (LSTM/XGBoost) to predict equipment failures and detect water quality anomalies before they occur, visualized on a TypeScript frontend.

Full-Stack E-Commerce Architecture with Recommendation Engine: Engineering a highly scalable e-commerce platform inspired by Flipkart. Built with a Java microservices backend and a Next.js/TypeScript frontend, featuring an integrated collaborative filtering ML model to serve personalized product recommendations to users.

Automated Open-Source Code Reviewer: Exploring the intersection of AI and open-source by fine-tuning lightweight LLMs to act as automated code reviewers. The tool analyzes pull requests in large-scale repositories for best practices, security flaws, and performance optimizations.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Expertise
Core Languages: Java, TypeScript, Python, Kotlin, JavaScript

AI, ML & Data: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NLP (Transformers), Time-Series Forecasting

Backend & Architecture: Spring Boot, Node.js/Express, Microservices Design, REST/GraphQL APIs, Event-Driven Architecture

Frontend: React, Next.js, Modern CSS Frameworks, State Management, Pixel-Perfect UI/UX

Tools & Infrastructure: Relational & NoSQL Databases, CI/CD Pipelines, Docker, Linux System Administration

Open Source: Passionate about reviewing public repositories and exploring large-scale codebases like Visual Studio Code.

⚡ Beyond the Screen
When I'm not architecting systems or reviewing pull requests, you can usually find me:

Diving into open-source ecosystems and exploring large-scale codebases like the Visual Studio Code repository.

Automating my day-to-day Linux system configurations with custom Python scripts.

Building a consistent reading habit with quick, engaging short stories.
